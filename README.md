# Docker - PERN App

I completed Smári´s tutorial on [The PERN stack with Docker for beginners](https://faun.pub/the-pern-stack-with-docker-for-beginners-9fa76e574d82) For practice I added one more column to the table and modified the app to display all of the data from the table. I added basic CSS styling only to make project readable.

## To run the app follow these steps

1. clone these two repositories:

2. in the client files run the app from your terminal by using first the cd dockerpern-tutorial command to move to the right folder then execute the yarn run start command
3. in the server files run the server from your terminal by using the node server.js command
4. view the app in your browser at http://localhost:3001

Make sure that you have yarn installed and both the client and the server are running at the same time
